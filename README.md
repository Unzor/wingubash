# Wingubash
Bash commands ported to Windows thru GnuWin32 CoreUtils, packaged with libintl-2 and libiconv-2.

# Usage
```
npm install -g wingubash
```
Make sure that there is a -g flag, otherwise you will have to run Wingubash with "npx &lt;your-bash-command-here&gt;  &lt;your-arguments&gt;" instead of being able to run it using only the command.

If you followed correctly, you should be able to use Bash commands in Windows. Test if it worked like this:

``env``

You should see your enviroment variables if installed correctly.
